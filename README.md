# react-web-app

A React web app that is built with testing in mind

## How to get started

### Install stuff

```bash
npm init -y
npm i create-react-app
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

### 🧪️Testing strategy

| Expected Behavior                       | Tested? | Test Type | Technologies |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------ |
| A URL with the right text exists        | 🙅‍♂️      |           |              |
| App renders correctly                   | 🙅‍♂️      |           |              |
| URL is correct                          | 🙅‍♂️      |           |              |
| App looks as expected on web and mobile | 🙅‍♂️      |           |              |
| Front-end performance is at least a B   | 🙅‍♂️      |           |              |
| App is secure                           | 🙅‍♂️      |           |              |
| App is accessibility friendly           | 🙅‍♂️      |           |              |

### Run the tests that come with our app

- In a new terminal `npm run test`

Now that everything is working, let's push this up to CI so that we can make sure it continues to work on other computers besides ours.

### Create CI Pipeline

- A little about [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Use the UI to setup a Workflow
- Paste in the following

```yaml
name: CI
env:
  SCREENER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SCREENER_API_KEY }}
  SAUCE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SAUCE_USERNAME }}
  SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY }}

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies 📦
        #Using npm ci is generally faster than running npm install
        run: |
          cd my-app
          npm ci
      - name: Build the app 🏗
        run: |
          cd my-app
          npm run build
      - name: Run component tests 🔸
        run: |
          cd my-app
          npm run test
      - name: Start the app 📤
        run: |
          cd my-app
          npm start &
          npx wait-on --timeout 60000
```

- Add secret variables
- Commit and watch it 🏃‍♀️

### Add another test

| Expected Behavior                       | Tested? | Test Type | Technologies                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| A URL with the right text exists        | ✅      | Component | React testing library, Jest |
| App renders correctly                   | 🙅‍♂️      |           |                             |
| URL is correct                          | 🙅‍♂️      |           |                             |
| App looks as expected on web and mobile | 🙅‍♂️      |           |                             |
| Front-end performance is at least a B   | 🙅‍♂️      |           |                             |
| App is secure                           | 🙅‍♂️      |           |                             |
| App is accessibility friendly           | 🙅‍♂️      |           |                             |

- Add a test for checking that the url is correct
- Update the url text
- Update the code to use a test id
- Commit and push to CI

### Shift-right and add a visual test

| Expected Behavior                       | Tested? | Test Type | Technologies                |

- Learn about [webdriverio](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted) and [screenerio](https://screener.io/)
- install wdio

```bash
npm install @wdio/cli
```

- setup wdio

`npx wdio config`

- paste the following code as the new test

```js
describe("My React application", () => {
  it("should look correct", () => {
    browser.url("");
    browser.execute("/*@visual.init*/", "My React App");
    browser.execute("/*@visual.snapshot*/", "Home Page");
    const result = browser.execute("/*@visual.end*/");
    expect(result.message).toBeNull();
  });
});
```
